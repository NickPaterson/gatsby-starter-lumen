When my raspberry pi had crashed before and I had flashed a new operating system on to the SD, however, when I tried to access it again, I had the same issues. Due to how unreliable it was proving to be I decided to take a different approach.
I already have my personal portfolio website hosted on Digital Ocean droplet and a spare domain that I have, I thought I would make use of it for this project.
The main issue was that MySql was not working, this has been something that I have been meaning to get around to fixing for months. The issue was due to it trying to update and being stuck on a locking loop.
```
2023-11-26T11:02:34.590617Z 4 [System] [MY-013381] [Server] Server upgrade from '80034' to '80035' started. 2023-11-26T11:03:24.678528Z 4 [ERROR] [MY-013178] [Server] Execution of server-side SQL statement 'EXECUTE stmt; ' failed with error code = 1205, error message = 'Lock wait timeout exceeded; try restarting transaction'. 2023-11-26T11:03:24.681876Z 0 [ERROR] [MY-013380] [Server] Failed to upgrade server.
```
After hours of debugging, and all the potential solutions online, required to sign in to MySql, but I couldnâ€™t even start the server.  I ended up uninstalling MySql to reinstall it.
Once MySql was installed again. When trying to install phpMyAdmin and enabling mbstring I was getting the following errors:
```
sudo phpenmod mbstring WARNING: Module mbstring ini file doesn't exist under /etc/php/8.1/mods-available WARNING: Module mbstring ini file doesn't exist under /etc/php/8.1/mods-available
```
However, using the grep command to search for the mbstring I could see that it did exist, so I was very confused why it wasnâ€™t working.

![grep mbstring](./media/mbstring.jpg)

After more hours spent on going through error logs and Googling the solution was simple, the command for installing the mbstring extension had to be more specific.
```
sudo apt-get -y install php8.1-mbstring
```
The command to enable this mod then worked.
```sudo phpenmod mbstring```

I finally had a working LAMP Stack! I could then start the process of configuring Apache to .update the domain to the new directory I was going to create the Laravel app.
Installing Laravel and Laravel Breeze, I had similar permission issues I had last time I installed it, however this time I knew how to fix them and I copied the files from my local directory, updated the environment variables such as the `APP_URL=https://cyli.co.uk` and inputting MySQL database, username and password.  The application was up and running on the live server ğŸ˜Š.
The only thing that wasnâ€™t working was the motorbike uploader, I was getting the following error message:

![error](./media/error.jpg)

To fix this I updated the form action to: ` route('motorbike.store')` and the `motorbike.php` routes file to

``` Route::post('/motorbike/create', [MotorbikeController::class, 'store'])
    ->middleware(['auth', 'verified'])
    ->name('motorbike.store');
```
Which solved the issue.
However, my images were not saving, after looking at the images directory the code was trying to save the images to, there was a permission issue!

![storage](./media/storage.png)

Forms submitted by the user, was saving new files and directories as the www-data user.  I updated the apache envvar configuration file to make the user oz:

![oz](./media/group.png)

Now I have MORE permission issues!

![permissions](./media/permissons.png)


I updated the permissions to this directory:

![updated permissions](./media/updated%20permissons.png)

Yes! Finally the images are now saving!

![saving](./media/saving.png)

New error!!

![images error](./media/errer-image-array.png)

```
Route::get('/motorbikes/{slug}', [MotorbikeController::class, 'show']);
```
```
public function show($slug): View
    {
        $motorbike = Motorbike::where('slug', $slug)->firstOrFail();

        return view('pages/motorbike', [
            'motorbike' => $motorbike,
            'images' => json_decode($motorbike->images)
        ]);
    }
```
