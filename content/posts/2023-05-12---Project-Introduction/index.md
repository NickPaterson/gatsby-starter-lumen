## Project Introduction

Welcome to my blog about a Laravel Motorbike Classifieds website! 

This project utilises Laravel web framework, coupled with Laravel Breeze for authentication and authenication.  
With basic Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) functionality, to provide users with a website in buying, selling, and managing motorbike listings.

The website can be found at [https://cyli.co.uk](https://cyli.co.uk).
