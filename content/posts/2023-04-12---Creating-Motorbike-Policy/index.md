Creating a CRUD operations policy
From reading the [Laravel Policies]( https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/authorization#creating-policies) and the from the lab slides.
Policies are classes are used to handle authorisation checks related to Eloquent models.  I will be making a policy for Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations on the motorbikes table,
Using php Artisan ` php artisan make:policy MotorbikePolicy`
This needs to be registered in the ` App\Providers\AuthServiceProvider`
I included the `Motorbike` model and Policy and registered the policy:
```
use App\Models\Motorbike;
use App\Policies\MotorbikePolicy;
```
```
    protected $policies = [
        Motorbike::class => MotorbikePolicy::class
    ];
```
I adding the following code to the `MotorbikePolicy.php` file
```
    public function create(User $user) {
        return $user!==null;
    }

    // anyone can read
    public function read(User $user) {
        return true;
    }

    // the user must be the owner
    public function update(User $user, Motorbike $motorbike) {
        return $user->id === $motorbike->user_id;
    }

    // the user must be the owner
    public function delete(User $user, Motorbike $motorbike) {
        return $user->id === $motorbike->user_id;
    }

```
To test this new policy, in the `motorbike.php` routes file I moved the ` Route::get('/motorbike/create', [MotorbikeController::class, 'create']);` out of the ` Route::middleware('auth')->group`. And added the middleware check `->middleware('can:create,App\Models\Motorbike')`

I logged in as a user, and got the motorbike upload form


[Motorbike page 200](./media/create-200.png)


As this was working, I updated all the CRUD motorbikes operations to
```
Route::get('/listings', [MotorbikeController::class, 'index'])->middleware('can:read,User');
Route::get('/motorbikes/{slug}', [MotorbikeController::class, 'show'])->middleware('can:read,User');

Route::middleware('auth')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/motorbike/create', [MotorbikeController::class, 'create'])->middleware('can:create,User,Motorbike');
    Route::post('/motorbike/create', [MotorbikeController::class, 'store'])->middleware('can:create,User,Motorbike')->name('motorbike.store');
    Route::get('/motorbike/edit/{slug}', [MotorbikeController::class, 'edit'])->middleware('can:update,User,motorbike')->name('motorbike.edit');
    Route::put('/motorbike/edit/{slug}', [MotorbikeController::class, 'update'])->middleware('can:update,User,Motorbike')->name('motorbike.update');
    Route::delete('/motorbike/{motorbike}', [MotorbikeController::class, 'destroy'])->middleware('can:delete,User,Motorbike')->name('motorbike.destroy');
});
```
The first check I made was to see if a user could still edit their own motorbikes, which they could not! I had done something wrong!
Looking back at the documentation, I seen further down that you can generate a policy for a given class, so I renamed my old policy and created a new one.
`php artisan make:policy MotorbikePolicy --model=Motorbike`
I was still getting the same issue, eventually I realised that it was due to the motorbike slug being passed through the URL rather than the motorbike id.
```
 Route::get('/motorbike/edit/{motorbike}', [MotorbikeController::class, 'edit'])->middleware('can:update,motorbike')->name('motorbike.edit');
    Route::put('/motorbike/edit/{slug}', [MotorbikeController::class, 'update'])->middleware('can:update,User,Motorbike')->name('motorbike.update');
```

When I updated all the relevant code to pass in the motorbike id, a user can only access the update form if the motorbike belongs to them.
Although the update wasnâ€™t working, even though I had change the code for this too.
I had downloaded a debug helper earlier, when loading the edit form in the Gate was showing that there a motorbike being pass in as an argument:


[Debug get request](./media/debug-get.png)

However, when I was submitting the form, it was just the id

[Debug put request](./media/debug-put.png)

After a while of trying to debug this, I decided to remove the middleware check for now! I also had to change more code for the `update` method in the `MotorbikeController` to work again!
The Delete seems to work, even with the middleware check! So, I do need to work out what the difference between the motorbike (the id) in the url getting passed in vs in via the form.
