I also installed another project for my Internet Technologies module.  The application was based on the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)

With both websites running on my Raspberry Pi, they both kept crashing. Monitoring the CPU and memory usage quickly revealed that I was pushing my hardware to the limit.

Due to all the crashes the SD Card that was serving as my main memory had become corrupted.  SD cards are not invincible; treat them with care, and always have backups at the ready, which I did not.

As I hadn't started any substantial work on my projects. I made the decision to reformat the SD card and flash a new operating system onto it, starting from stratch.
